#+title: Meeting Notes


* <2024-01-04 Thu>
** Contributions?
+ One Option
  + We have a toolbox that is available.
  + Use the COCO paper.
  + Choose at least 2, perhaps 3 examples.
  + Plot: Accuracy vs Effort.
  + Title: Comparing the Wave Based Method 
+ Another option
  + Comparison of FEM and WBM in terms of effort, accuracy, etc.
  + Studying problems that haven't been studied using the WB method as yet in the literature
+ Another
  + Make vibro-impact as the theme
  + Come up with an example with buildings so that we have a frame structure?
  + 2-story building
+ Gap: Stability approach for secondary Hopf.
+ Examples: Impacting Beams, Rotor Dynamics, Frame problem, etc.
** Results?
+ Improve table 3.
+ Plot of error versus solver effort
** Steps
+ Solve linear harmonically forced system with "rigid" joints. Harmonically forced. Compute FRF and validate with Prof. Leamy's code.

+ Analyze impacting two-story problem motivated from literature. Stability as well.
+ Contributions:
  1. Extending WBV to Timoshenko beams with axial extension (above & beyond what Chouvion did).
  2. Opens anaysis of frames.
  3. Open-source toolbox that does most of the work, with stability. Graph adjacency approach. 
+ Results
  1. Analysis of vibro-impact systems using WBV approach.
  2. Convergence vs FE for earlier impacting problem.
