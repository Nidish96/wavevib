# WaveVib

WaveVib is intended to be a set of OCTAVE/MATLAB routines that can be used to study wave-based linear and nonlinear structures. 
The main advantage with using this approach comes from the fact that the linear portions of the problem are represented without 
any approximation (unlike weighted residual or variational approaches). Immediate use cases include jointed beams, trusses, 
frame structures, fluid-filled columns, rotordynamics, etc.

A good starting place for the new user are the papers Balaji, Brake, Leamy (2022a,b) [1,2].

The "EXAMPLES" folder contains examples with most of the core functionality.

The "DEVEL" folder is for development purposes. Collaborations are welcome.

TODO: 
1. Stability Implementation
2. Quasi-Periodic Calculations
3. 3D frame joint constitutions
4. Joints connecting multiple pieces
5. More detailed examples
